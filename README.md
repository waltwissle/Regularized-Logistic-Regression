# Regularized-Logistic-Regression

This is regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. 
Two test were conducted for some microchips. From these two tests, we would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help make the decision, the dataset of test results on past microchips are provided, from which we can build a logistic regression model.

Accept: Y = 1
Rejected: Y = 0
